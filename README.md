### Hi there ðŸ‘‹




I've been enjoying web development since I started my project "CoffeHub"; a cross-platform app for coffee shop owners. 
I'm currently on the lookout for a role in full-stack web development, ideally writing JavaScript or Python. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight-knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
